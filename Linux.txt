Linux Administration
-------------------------
User management

create user, add user to any group

useradd <user-name> --> creates user and group with same name
id <user-name> --> displays user information
/etc/passwd --> contains user information
/etc/group --> contains group information
in linux, a user must have only one primary group and atleast secondary group
passwd <user-name> --> sets password to the user

groupadd <group-name> --> creates group

usermod -g devops ramesh --> adds ramesh to devops group
usermod -aG testing ramesh --> adds testing as secondary group to ramesh



CRUD --> 

userdel <user-name> 
remove from project,now remove from company

remove him from devops group 

Linux follows key based authentication by default

/etc/ssh/sshd_config --> edit the SSH related configuration
/etc/ssh/sshd_config --> any mistakes in this file, we cant ssh into server
systemctl restart sshd
sshd -t --> check config is correct or not

key based authentication --> ramesh should generate his public key and private key...



Permissions
-----------------
R -> 4
W -> 2
X -> 1

- 		rw- 					r-- 			r-- 	ec2-user ec2-user
file    <owner-who-created>     <group>			<others>

ec2-user --> Owner --> Read and Write
ec2-user --> Group --> Only Read
Others --> Other than and owner and group --> Only read

Who can change permissions of file or folder --> owners or root user

owner/user --> u
group --> g
others --> o

chmod o+w devsecops.txt
chmod o-r suresh.txt

chmod ugo+rwx suresh.txt

chmod 740 suresh.txt
chmod 777 suresh.txt
chmod 755 suresh.txt


admin should ask for suresh public key
root user can create a folder .ssh in /home/suresh
ownership of the folder should be on suresh
chown -R suresh:suresh .ssh
chown <user>:<group> file/folder

inside .ssh we need to create a file called authorized_keys
this file owner should be suresh
permissions can be max 600

ssh -i suresh.pem suresh@IP

/home/suresh --> authorized_keys
